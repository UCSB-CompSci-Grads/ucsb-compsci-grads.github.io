# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I sent an email to grad advising some time ago and never heard back. What's up?**

A: Unfortunately emails tend to get lost in grad advising's inbox. The best way to talk to grad advising is to make an appointment on Calendly, which is linked in the [CS Advising Linktree](https://linktr.ee/ucsbcsgradprogram).

**Q: Why can't I add a car through the TPS portal to get my parking pass?**

A: TPS needs to manually approve your car registration, so students cannot add a vehicle through the portal themselves (or so I'm told). It's easiest and fastest to go [to the TPS office](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TmTeDBbYinp9bWk4A) in my experience, but you can also try emailing. Once the car is added, buying new *permits* through the portal should not be an issue.
