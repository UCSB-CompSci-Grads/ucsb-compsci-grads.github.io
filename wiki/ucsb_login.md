# Your UCSB Login and Identity

UCSB uses one login system, your NetID, for everything, which includes Clearpass (the login page for everything *except* MyBarc, which has its own login page but still uses your NetID) and Duo Multi-Factor Authentication. You can create a NetID about 24 hours after signing your Statement of Intent to Register (SIR). Information on NetID activation can be found here: [https://www.identity.ucsb.edu/index.php/ucsbnetid/activation](https://www.identity.ucsb.edu/index.php/ucsbnetid/activation)

In order to log in to your UCSB accounts, you will need to have Duo MFA installed on your phone (or ask for a physical MFA key).

Management of your UCSB login and identity can be found at [https://im.ucsb.edu/](https://im.ucsb.edu/), where you can update:

- Your lived name
- Your identity information
- Your password
- Your personal phone number and email (for recovery purposes)
- Your security questions


More information on changing your lived or legal name at UCSB can be found at this page: [https://www.identity.ucsb.edu/gender-recognition-and-lived-name-identity](https://www.identity.ucsb.edu/gender-recognition-and-lived-name-identity).
